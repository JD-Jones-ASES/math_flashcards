# AI Assisted Productivity in Education

This package was written by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet with human guidance. With few exceptions, all files, including this one, were originally generated by Claude. This should be considered a proof of concept, showing that teachers can make on-demand, targeted, AI-assisted resources for their schools. I have attempted to follow reasonable licensing and versioning conventions, opting for complete open source. Please pardon lapses in proper practice. Claude did the best he could.

Chat GPT 4o helped with signing certifications, GitHub setup, and debugging small problems.

Grok 2 (Beta) made the icon.
